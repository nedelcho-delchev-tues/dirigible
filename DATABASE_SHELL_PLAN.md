# Database shell (Harmonia) — plan, feasibility & cost

A new **Database** shell at the application layer: a Harmonia/Alpine re-imagining of the IDE's
Database perspective, scoped to **support essentials only** — browse the schema, look at data, run a
SQL fix. It gives operators and support engineers a way to touch the database without opening the
IDE, exactly the way the Monitoring shell answers "is the system healthy?" without the IDE.

Status: **in delivery.** PR 0 is the Harmonia bump (#6656), PR 1 the URL-layer gate (#6657), PR 2
this shell. Prior art: the Monitoring shell (`components/resources/resources-monitoring`,
PRs #6613–#6615) — the only existing single-purpose operations shell and the construction template
this plan clones.

### Corrections to this plan, found while building it

- **The bump was to 2.9.0 at the time (2.10.0 had no webjar yet); the platform has since moved on to
  3.1.2.** The `getBreakpointListener` third argument is deliberately left at its default
  (`topFrame = false`): the listener then measures the frame it runs in, which is what the CSS
  breakpoint variants resolve against, so the shells calling it pass nothing. (An earlier note here
  asked them to pass `true`; Harmonia's own docs argue the opposite, and the docs win.)
- **The `data-disabled` sweep was a bug fix, not a rename.** `data-disabled` on a root `x-h-select`
  never did anything, even on 2.6.0: it was always a per-*option* attribute, and the whole control
  is disabled through native `disabled` on `x-h-select-input`. Preview-mode and read-only dropdowns
  in the generated apps were never actually disabled. They are now.
- **Two breaking changes the plan did not list** turned out to matter: the 2.7.0 slot-picker stopped
  collapsing its day columns on narrow screens by itself (`.responsive` restores it), and 2.7.0
  moved an option's label into a text column, which broke one IT assertion that demanded exactly one
  `<span>` per label.
- **Lazy tree loading must not own the expanded state.** A 2.9 tree item detects its own children
  and owns whether it is expanded, so a second owner in the store fights it. The shell instead
  renders one placeholder child under an unloaded node — which is what gives the row its chevron
  before anything has been fetched — and the `tree-item-click` handler only loads.

## Goal

- A standalone Harmonia shell served at `/services/web/database/`, registered on `platform-shells`
  (shell id `databaseShell`, icon `database`, order 38 — between Monitoring 37 and the IDE 40).
- Two pages: an **Explorer** (datasource → schema → tables/views/procedures → columns tree, "show
  contents" grid, DDL view) and a **SQL Console** (statement area, results grid, messages strip).
- **Zero new backend.** Every read and execute goes through endpoints that already ship in
  `components/data/*`, all method-gated `@RolesAllowed({ADMINISTRATOR, DEVELOPER, OPERATOR})`.
- Role gate: `database.access` on `/database/` for ADMINISTRATOR / OPERATOR / DEVELOPER — the same
  trio the endpoints declare, so the shell never renders a page its user cannot use.

## Verdict

**Highly feasible, low risk.** The backend surface exists 1:1; the shell skeleton, shared runtime,
page pattern, registration plumbing and IT pattern are all proven by the Monitoring shell; Harmonia
(as of 2.10.0) carries every component the UI needs (`tree`, `table`, `split`, `tabs`, `select`,
`menu`/`popover`). Estimated cost: **~2.5–3k LOC across 2–3 PRs, roughly 1–1.5 weeks** of focused
effort, of which the single real prerequisite — the Harmonia webjar bump 2.6.0 → 2.10.0 — carries
most of the risk.

## Scope

### In (support essentials)

- Datasource picker (names from `GET /services/data/metadata`), current selection in an Alpine
  store, persisted to localStorage (the IDE does the same via
  `${brand.prefix}.view-db-explorer.database`).
- Lazy metadata tree: schema → tables / views / procedures → columns. Fixed depth, so plain nested
  `x-for` — no recursive templates needed.
- "Show contents" — a generated `SELECT` executed through `/query`, rendered in an `x-h-table` with
  dynamic columns and client-side pagination.
- Object DDL via `GET /services/data/definition/{ds}/{schema}/{structure}`.
- SQL Console: monospace textarea (NOT Monaco — see decisions), Ctrl/Cmd+Enter to execute, results
  grid, update counts / errors in a messages strip, statement text persisted in localStorage.
- Explorer row actions: Show contents, Copy name, Generate SELECT into the console.
- Metadata cache refresh (`GET /services/data/metadata/invalidate-cache`).
- i18n en-US + bg-BG, following the `i18n/<locale>/<project>.json` aggregator convention.

### Out (deliberate — decided 2026-08-11)

- **Import / export** (sync + async), **anonymization**, **data transfer** (the WebSocket), **schema
  export/import processes** — not support essentials; also exactly the endpoints restricted to
  ADMINISTRATOR/OPERATOR-only, so cutting them keeps the role story uniform.
- **Datasource CRUD** (`/services/data/sources`) — the shell consumes datasources, it does not
  manage them.
- **Row-edit dialogs** (the IDE's `result-view-crud` + the server-side JS `databaseTable.js` path) —
  the SQL console covers support writes; optional later phase.
- **Monaco** — a support console does not justify embedding a multi-MB editor in an app-layer shell.
- Re-implementing anything the Workbench Database perspective does deeply (script generation beyond
  a SELECT, project exports, topology). Each page links to the IDE instead — the Monitoring shell's
  scope line, applied here.

## Backend inventory (all existing, no changes required)

Prefix from `BaseEndpoint`: `/services/data/`. Datasource/schema are **always path variables** —
no server-side "current datasource" session state; every request is self-describing.

| Need | Endpoint | Roles |
|---|---|---|
| List datasources | `GET /services/data/metadata` | ADMIN, DEV, OPERATOR |
| Datasource → schemas | `GET /services/data/metadata/{ds}` | ADMIN, DEV, OPERATOR |
| Schema → objects | `GET /services/data/metadata/{ds}/{schema}` | ADMIN, DEV, OPERATOR |
| Object metadata (columns…) | `GET /services/data/metadata/{ds}/{schema}/{structure}?kind=` — structure name **Base64-encoded** in the path | ADMIN, DEV, OPERATOR |
| Object DDL | `GET /services/data/definition/{ds}/{schema}/{structure}` | ADMIN, DEV, OPERATOR |
| Run SELECT | `POST /services/data/{ds}/query` — body raw SQL, `Content-Type: text/plain` | ADMIN, DEV, OPERATOR |
| Run UPDATE / DDL | `POST /services/data/{ds}/update` | ADMIN, DEV, OPERATOR |
| Call procedure | `POST /services/data/{ds}/procedure` | ADMIN, DEV, OPERATOR |
| Refresh metadata cache | `GET /services/data/metadata/invalidate-cache` | ADMIN, DEV, OPERATOR |

### Server contracts the new client must knowingly inherit

These are de-facto contracts of `DatabaseExecutionEndpoint` / `DatabaseExecutionService`, not bugs
to fix in this effort:

- **Statement dispatch is a prefix sniff**, not parsing (the IDE's `result.js` does the same):
  `select …` → `/query`, `call …` → `/procedure`, `query: …` → `/query` with the prefix stripped
  (NoSQL, e.g. MongoDB find), `update: …` → `/update` stripped, everything else → `/update`.
  Replicate exactly.
- **Response format branches on an *exact* `Accept` match** (`text/plain` → monospaced table,
  `text/csv` → CSV, anything else → JSON). Send a plain `Accept: application/json` and always take
  the JSON branch.
- **Results are silently capped** server-side at `DIRIGIBLE_DATABASE_DEFAULT_QUERY_LIMIT`
  (default 1000) with **no truncation marker in the payload**. The grid must label honestly:
  "showing N rows — the server may cap results" (at least when N looks like a round cap). The IDE
  never surfaced this; the support shell should.
- **Procedure results are double-encoded**: a JSON array whose elements are JSON *strings* —
  `JSON.parse` each element.
- The service splits multi-statement bodies on `;` (on `--` when the body contains
  `CREATE PROCEDURE`/`CREATE TRIGGER`) and streams results per statement; an error mid-stream
  surfaces as a 500 on an already-committed response — render whatever arrived plus the error.
- **Encode names consistently from day one.** Metadata/definition paths take the structure name
  Base64-encoded; anywhere else, encode per path segment. The IDE breaks on schema/table names
  containing `.` (it splits `"schema.table"` on the dot); greenfield code must not copy that.

### Optional hardening (recommended, own small PR)

`/services/data/**` has **no URL-layer gate** in `HttpSecurityURIConfigurator` — it falls through to
`AUTHENTICATED_PATTERNS` (`/services/**` → `authenticated()`), so method-level `@RolesAllowed` is
the only rejection. Mirror what the Monitoring shell did in #6613: add `/services/data/**` to the
operations `RoleGate` (ADMINISTRATOR/DEVELOPER/OPERATOR) ahead of the catch-all, and extend
`HttpSecurityURIConfiguratorTest`'s matrix. ~60 LOC of defense-in-depth. Note the endpoints are
mixed-role (export/import/anonymize are ADMIN/OPERATOR-only, stricter than the gate) — the URL gate
must use the **widest** legitimate set and leave the finer method-level checks in place.

**Independent platform gap found while mapping — report it privately, do NOT open a public issue.**
The `/websockets/data/transfer` handler (`DataTransferWebsocketHandler`, `data-transfer`) carries no
role check at all and `/websockets/**` is merely `authenticated()` — any authenticated user can
drive data transfer, unlike every REST sibling in `components/data/` (all ADMINISTRATOR + OPERATOR).
`SECURITY.md` routes undisclosed vulnerabilities to the Eclipse Security Team or a committers-only
Bugzilla entry, so this belongs there rather than in the issue tracker. It is deliberately kept out
of PR 1: that PR is a strict no-op for every existing caller, while fixing this changes who may use
a feature, and the right role set is a policy call (DEVELOPER opens the IDE's Transfer view).

## Target architecture

New module **`components/resources/resources-database`** (`dirigible-components-resources-database`),
web assets under `src/main/resources/META-INF/dirigible/database/`. A straight clone of the
`resources-monitoring` skeleton — the only live single-purpose operations shell (admin / personal /
application are *host* shells whose large `appShell.js` exists to mount extension-contributed
perspectives; not the right template).

```

Everything cross-cutting comes from the **shared** runtime at
`/services/web/application-core/shell/` by absolute URL (app.js, i18n/api/apiError/format/branding
services, theme/locale/currentUser/shells stores, base css) — no per-project copies. Script order in
`index.html` is load-bearing (Pinecone → shared runtime → config → local services/stores/pages →
appShell → Alpine → Harmonia bundle, which auto-starts Alpine → Lucide last).

Registration edits outside the module: `components/pom.xml` (module + dependencyManagement),
`components/group/group-ui/pom.xml` (assembly dependency), `resources-home`'s `home.js` (icon map,
description, SECONDARY list — a support tool is a secondary destination, like Monitoring).

### Page conventions (carried from Monitoring)

- Per page: an Alpine **store** (data + async actions, never touches DOM), an Alpine **page
  component** (`Alpine.data('explorerPage')` — formatting, derived getters, calls
  `$store.explorer.load()` in `init()`), and a **view fragment**.
- Every endpoint read goes through `dbops.js`; aggregate reads wrap in `soft()` so an unavailable
  datasource degrades to a marked tile, not an empty screen.
- Stable ids for the IT: sidebar buttons `database-nav-<section>`, page roots
  `database-<section>-page`.
- Alpine/Lucide trap: a bound `:data-lucide` goes on `<svg x-h-lucide>`, never `<i x-h-lucide>` —
  the plugin replaces the element and the throw silently aborts Alpine's walk (the failure mode
  `MonitoringShellIT` exists to catch).
- Tree: Harmonia ≥2.9 API (`x-h-tree-row` / `x-h-tree-label` / `x-h-tree-actions`, selection driven
  by the `tree-item-click` event — the tree keeps no selection model of its own). Lazy loading =
  fetch children on first expand, cache in the store.

## Prerequisite: Harmonia 2.6.0 → 2.10.0 (PR 0)

The root pom pins `harmonia.version` 2.6.0; the **tree was rebuilt with breaking changes in 2.9.0**
(`x-h-tree-button` → row/label/actions/indicator, new `tree-item-click` event). Building the
explorer on the 2.6.0 tree API would be instant legacy — bump first. Measured blast radius:

- Old tree API: **one file** — `template-application-ui-harmonia-java`'s
  `ui/perspective/manage/list-view.html.template` (the tree-list layout).
- Removed `data-disabled` / `data-label`: **three templates** (`admin-index.html.template`,
  `document/document-view.html.template`, `manage/form-view.html.template`). The
  `resources-karavan-libs` grep hit is a bundled third-party React app — not Harmonia markup.
- 2.9.0 also reworked **sidebar group actions** and the **`aria-disabled` keyboard behaviour** —
  verification pass over the five existing shells' `index.html` (application, monitoring, admin,
  personal, partner) plus the Harmonia templates.
- Per the established bump procedure: read the upstream CHANGELOG (2.7 → 2.10), regenerate the
  sample apps after the template migrations, full IT run.

## Phasing / PR sequence

| PR | Content | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Harmonia bump 2.6.0 → **2.9.0**: pom pin, tree-template migration, slot-picker `.responsive`, `data-disabled` fix, one IT assertion | 7 files | **#6656 open**, 6 UI journeys green |
| 1 | `/services/data/**` URL-layer gate + `HttpSecurityURIConfiguratorTest` matrix rows | 3 files | **#6657 open**, 30 unit tests green |
| 2 | The shell: module skeleton, `dbops.js`, two store/page/view triples, registration edits, i18n, `DatabaseShellIT` | ~1,300 LOC, 18 files | in progress |

Calibration: the Monitoring shell landed as three PRs totalling +3,932 LOC over 46 files, six pages,
zero Java in the module. This shell has fewer pages (2 vs 6) but denser ones — the lazy tree and the
arbitrary-columns results grid are the two components Monitoring never needed. **Total: ~1–1.5 weeks
end to end including the bump** — materially less if the bump happens anyway for other reasons.

## Testing

- **`DatabaseShellIT`** (`@Tag("ui")`, `UserInterfaceIntegrationTest`) — the MonitoringShellIT
  pattern, ~100 LOC: (1) the Explorer renders shell chrome, the tree shows `DefaultDB` schemas, and
  a store poll resolved (catches the Alpine-bootstrap abort, which has no DOM or server symptom);
  (2) every section reachable by `database-nav-<x>` id, asserted on `database-<x>-page` with
  deployment-independent text; (3) the SQL console executes a `SELECT 1`-class statement against
  DefaultDB and the grid renders a row — the one end-to-end journey worth the browser.
- The backend needs no new tests (unchanged); PR 1's gate change extends the existing
  `HttpSecurityURIConfiguratorTest`.

## Key decisions & risks

1. **Textarea, not Monaco** (decision). Support usage doesn't justify a multi-MB editor; localStorage
   persistence and Ctrl/Cmd+Enter match the IDE's muscle memory. Revisit only on real demand
   (CodeMirror-class, lazy-loaded like Monitoring's bpmn-visualization, would be the shape).
2. **The Harmonia bump is the main risk** — a platform-wide change riding ahead of a feature.
   Mitigated by its own PR, the small measured breaking-change inventory above, and the full IT
   suite.
3. **Silent row cap UX** — inherent to the backend; label it, don't fix it here.
4. **Write access is the point, and the gate is roles, not the shell.** The shell deliberately
   allows UPDATE/DDL (a support tool that can't fix data is a dashboard). Safety comes from the
   `.access` file + the endpoints' `@RolesAllowed` (+ PR 1's URL gate), not from hiding buttons.
   No confirmation theatre beyond a destructive-statement confirm on non-`select` execution.
5. **Don't port the IDE's bugs.** Known in the AngularJS stack and out of scope to copy: a dead
   `delete` branch in `result.js` row CRUD, a `$destroy` throw on an undeclared listener, the
   dot-splitting of `schema.table`, and the never-wired `database.database.selection.changed`
   (database-kind) topic. Greenfield code replaces the whole MessageHub topic web with two Alpine
   stores.

## Explicitly out of scope

Import/export (sync/async), anonymization, data transfer, schema export/import processes,
datasource CRUD, row-edit dialogs, Monaco, procedure/script generation beyond SELECT, project
exports, topology — the Workbench Database perspective remains the deep tool; this shell links to it.
