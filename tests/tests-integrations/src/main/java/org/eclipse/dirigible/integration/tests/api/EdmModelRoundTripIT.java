/**
 * The {@code .edm} must be a lossless source for the derived {@code .model} (#6826). Intent
 * Generate writes {@code <name>.edm} and a complete {@code <name>.model} together; the loss used to
 * happen when the {@code .edm} was used to rebuild the {@code .model} - opening a diagram and
 * saving it, which regenerates the model from the {@code .edm} via {@code transform-edm.js},
 * dropped every structured (List/Map) attribute (rollupGuard, checks, uniqueConstraints, ...)
 * because they never reached the {@code .edm}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This drives the real round-trip over HTTP, no browser: generate from an intent that exercises the
 * structured values, capture the intent's {@code .model} (the oracle), then save the {@code .edm}
 * back through the workspace API (which fires the same {@code ide-workspace-on-save} transform the
 * editor's save does) and assert the regenerated {@code .model} carries every structured value
 * intact. A structural diff of every entity/property key against the oracle then makes the
 * guarantee complete: a future structured attribute forgotten in the generator's set is dropped
 * from the {@code .edm} and caught here as a missing key, and one written but not parsed back is
 * caught as a value mismatch - so a structured attribute cannot ship without {@code .edm}
 * serialization support.
 *
 * <p>
 * Losslessness has a second failure mode the same round-trip exposes: not a value DROPPED, but a
 * value written TWICE and disagreeing with itself (#6883). A to-one relation's identity used to be
 * derived independently by the {@code <property>} element (from the TARGET entity) and by the
 * {@code <relation>} element (from the RELATION name), and the save applied the second over the
 * first - so an unmodified save renamed relationships and, for a cross-model target, repointed the
 * generated lookup URL at a controller that does not exist. That divergence was invisible to this
 * test because every relation in its intent was named after its target, which makes the two
 * derivations produce the same string. The fixture below deliberately breaks that coincidence -
 * relations named for their ROLE, two of them to the same target, and one cross-model target
 * published under a perspective that is not its entity name - and asserts the {@code .edm} is
 * internally consistent before the save is even attempted.
