/**
 * DSL emission + runtime coverage: for the intent features whose enforcement lives in GENERATED
 * code, assert (1) the generated artifacts CONTAIN the enforcement, and (2) the published app
 * ENFORCES it over REST.
 *
 * <p>
 * This test exists because the generation pipeline degrades silently: Velocity skips undefined
 * variables, an unknown seed-row key is dropped (and a NOT NULL FK then makes CSVIM skip every
 * row), and a stale registry template generates feature-less code - all with every pipeline step
 * returning success. A feature's test must therefore assert the OUTERMOST observable layer (the
 * generated token at minimum, the runtime behavior where reachable), never only the parsed model.
 * Covered here: {@code immutableWhen} / {@code immutable} (409 on write/delete, and the lock
 * inherited by a composition child - a line of a locked document is refused while a child that
 * declared {@code locksWithMaster: false} keeps its writes), {@code immutableInPeriod} (the same
 * 409 keyed on a period register's status instead - a record booked into an open period stops being
 * writable when the period around it closes, a create into or a move into a closed one is refused,
 * and a date no period covers stays writable), {@code checks} (exactlyOne / itemsMin /
 * itemsSumEqual - including that a document gate counts the document's LINES and not a sibling
 * composition child such as its printed copy), {@code hierarchy}/{@code leafOnly},
 * {@code multilingual} (the read-time overlay on an entity read, and its SQL counterpart on a
 * report grouping by that nomenclature - the two must agree on the same value in the same
 * language), seed rows carrying a RELATION column, aggregate totals, first-class {@code number:}
 * stamping from an authored {@code .numbers} series declaration, {@code transitions} (the guarded
 * on-demand status flip: allowed-status 200, wrong-status/guard 409), {@code lifecycle} (the
 * declarative state machine: the graph walked through its transitions, an unmodeled flip and a
 * create filed mid-lifecycle both refused through the plain REST surface no transition guard
 * covers), {@code postings} with {@code reverses} (post on a transition; red-storno reversal on
 * void - negated amounts, storno link, fail-soft), the {@code notify} block with
 * {@code attach: print} (send the document itself by e-mail - on a transition and on a process
 * step; the fail-soft contract), {@code calculatedActionOnCreate} on a to-one RELATION (the FK
 * resolved server-side by a hand-written {@code custom/} action: assigned in the repository, and at
 * runtime both defaulted when omitted and left alone when the caller supplied one), the
 * event-driven {@code generates} (posting the source mints the whole document with nobody clicking,
 * and a click afterwards returns that same document - the at-most-once back-reference guard), and
 * the personal (my) surface ({@code identity}/{@code personal}/{@code sensitive}: scoped reads,
 * forced owner, stripped fields).
