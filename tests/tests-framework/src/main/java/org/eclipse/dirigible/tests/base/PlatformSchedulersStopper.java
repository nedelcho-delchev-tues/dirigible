/**
 * Destroys the platform's schedulers before {@link DirigibleCleaner} drops the SystemDB schema they
 * run on.
 * <p>
 * Both of them keep polling that schema in the background - Quartz's cluster manager checks in on
 * {@code qrtz_scheduler_state}, Flowable's async executor acquires from {@code act_ru_job} - and
 * both issue a last round of statements when they are closed. The cleaner runs from a
 * {@code @PreDestroy}, i.e. while every other bean is still alive, so on PostgreSQL - where the
 * schema really is dropped instead of being discarded with the JVM, as the file-backed H2 SystemDB
 * is - each of those threads then logged an ERROR with a stack trace per poll: hundreds per CI
 * shard behind a green run, which is what made a PostgreSQL job log unreadable (#7285).
 * <p>
 * The beans are destroyed through the bean factory rather than shut down through their own APIs:
 * that runs Spring's own destruction for them exactly once, at a moment when their tables still
 * exist, and de-registers them, so the context close that follows does not close them a second time
 * against the dropped schema. Their dependents are destroyed with them, as during any context
 * close.
