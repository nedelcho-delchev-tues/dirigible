 * Programmatic Flowable process deployer — sibling to the {@code .bpmn} synchronizer for the cases
 * where you need to push process definitions from code (one-off migrations, sample data loaders,
 * tests).
 * <p>
 * {@link #deployProcess(String)} accepts a path inside the platform repository (typically under
 * {@code /registry/public/<project>/<file>.bpmn}); the returned id is Flowable's deployment id,
 * which you then pass to {@link #undeployProcess(String)} or {@link #deleteProcess(String, String)}
 * to clean up.
 * <p>
 * For long-lived processes the synchronizer-based flow is preferable — drop the {@code .bpmn} into
 * the project and let the platform pick it up; reach for this class only when ad-hoc deployment is
 * actually required.
