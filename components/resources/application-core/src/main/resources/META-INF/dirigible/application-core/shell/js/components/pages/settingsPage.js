/**
 * settingsPage — the built-in Settings section as a master-detail: every settings item is a row in
 * the list on the left, its content opens in the pane on the right. The platform preferences (the
 * language flag and the display formats) share one pane and render from the page's own markup; a
 * SETTING entity's generated manage-list view is fetched only when its row is picked, so a module
 * declaring many nomenclatures loads one of them, not all of them. That embedded list opens
 * create/edit/preview in the shared related-record dialog instead of navigating, so this pane keeps
 * its place (the list page's inlineHosted()).
 *
 * The fetch and the render are Harmonia's: the pane's host carries x-h-include, which loads the
 * fragment and initializes Alpine on it. Deliberately NOT a reactive x-html="content" binding -
 * Alpine re-runs such an effect on its own account, and a re-run replaces the whole injected
 * subtree: measured in a browser, opening the embedded list's Filter popover or its record sheet
 * rebuilt the fragment in the same tick, destroying the overlay that had just opened and loading the
 * entity a second time.
 *
 * What x-h-include does not do is report a failure - its only error path is a console.error - so the
 * page watches for the fragment:loaded event it dispatches and calls a missing fragment when that
 * event does not arrive. A silent blank pane would be the one outcome nobody can act on.
