 * locale store — the PLATFORM's single language flag (the Region & Language setting). A global
 * store (like the theme) persisted per user in localStorage. The shared fetch client
 * (services/api.js) sends the value as Accept-Language on every call, so the same flag drives
 * BOTH the frontend and the backend: generated multilingual repositories overlay <TABLE>_LANG
 * values for it, and the document Print flow prefers it. The offered codes are the platform's
 * supported language set (DIRIGIBLE_APPLICATION_LANGUAGES, default en) — individual modules
 * never define what the stack supports; they only provide translations, and anything a module
 * does not translate falls back to the base (first/default) language naturally.
 *
 * A saved value is only a candidate until that set is known: a code the instance does not offer
 * falls back to the first entry once the set arrives, so a request sent before then would carry a
 * language the requests after it do not (#7558). settled() is the moment the value is final; the
 * fetch client waits for it before it stamps Accept-Language.
