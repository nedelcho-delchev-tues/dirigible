 *
 * The server's `errorMessage` is developer-facing and MUST NOT be shown to the
 * end-user (it is logged to the console by api.js). The UI selects what to
 * display based on `errorType` via the resolvers below.
 *
 * Designed for later i18n: swap the flat maps for a locale lookup in one place.
