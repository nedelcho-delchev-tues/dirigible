/**
 * Watches {@code /registry/public} <b>recursively</b> and marks the registry modified whenever
 * something in it changes, so that the next synchronization pass actually runs.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link SynchronizationWatcher} - the thing {@code SynchronizationProcessor} asks before it does
 * anything at all - registers the registry root and nothing below it, so a file written several
 * folders deep produces no event and no pass is ever scheduled for it. A publish is covered
 * ({@code SynchronizationWatcherPublisherHandler} forces a pass) and so is the external-folder copy
 * ({@link RecursiveFolderWatcher} brackets and forces its own writes), but a writer that does
 * neither used to be invisible for the life of the process - the shape of #7192, where a partial
 * client-Java generation stayed installed with all its sources on disk. This watcher closes that
 * gap generically: whatever writes the registry, the write is seen and a pass follows.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>It does not make
 * {@link org.eclipse.dirigible.components.base.registry.RegistryMutationTracker} optional.</b> A
 * pass is now scheduled while a multi-file write is still arriving, and only the bracket tells that
 * pass to defer its cleanup instead of reaping artefacts whose sources have not landed yet. A
 * component that writes the registry outside the publisher pipeline still brackets the write - what
 * it no longer has to do is remember to announce it.
 *
 * <p>
 * Marking is deliberately all this does. {@link SynchronizationWatcher#force()} sets a flag; which
 * pass runs, when, and over what is the processor's decision, so a copy of a thousand files costs a
 * thousand flag writes and one pass rather than a pass per file. The folders named by
 * {@code DIRIGIBLE_REGISTRY_LOCAL_IGNORED_FOLDERS} (top level only) are neither watched nor marked.
 *
 * <p>
 * Nor is a {@code .js}/{@code .mjs} write, wherever it lands (#7368): no synchronizer is ever keyed
 * on those extensions, so the platform's TypeScript transpiler - which rewrites its compiled output
 * next to every {@code .ts} source on the first request after a publish, and again on every
 * {@code tsc --watch} re-transpile - stopped otherwise scheduling a full pass for output that
 * changes no artefact.

     * If the close does wedge, teardown proceeds and the JVM is free to exit anyway - the poller the
     * service leaves behind is itself a daemon thread.
