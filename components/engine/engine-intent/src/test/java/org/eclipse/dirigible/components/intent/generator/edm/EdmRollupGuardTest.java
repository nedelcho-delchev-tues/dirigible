/**
 * The capacity guard a capacity-bearing sum roll-up stamps on its CHILD entity: the synchronous
 * check in the child's generated repository that refuses a write overdrawing the parent.
 *
 * The child is always local (it owns the event the roll-up binds to), so the guard is emitted from
 * this model whether the parent is local or owned by another module - which is what lets both sides
 * of an allocation be guarded (#7410). Only the parent's coordinates differ.
