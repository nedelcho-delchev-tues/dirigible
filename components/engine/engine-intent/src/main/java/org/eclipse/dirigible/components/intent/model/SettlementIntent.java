/**
 * An auto-settlement (payment allocation) between two entities linked by a junction carrying an
 * amount - e.g. allocate a {@code CustomerPayment} across a customer's open {@code SalesInvoice}s
 * via the {@code SalesInvoiceCustomerPayment} junction, oldest first.
 *
 * <p>
 * Generates two client-Java glue classes: an {@code onPayment} {@code MessageHandler} (on the
 * payment's create event, spreads the payment across open invoices) and an {@code onInvoice}
 * {@code JavaDelegate} (wired as a {@code delegate:} service task after the invoice becomes
 * payable, pulls the customer's unallocated payment balance onto it). Allocation for both
 * directions is bounded by the invoice open amount ({@link #total} - {@link #paid}) and the payment
 * pot ({@link #pot} minus what it has already allocated), and restricted to rows agreeing on every
 * {@link #match} relation.
