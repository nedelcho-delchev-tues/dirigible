/**
 * A "create-from" (document generation) declaration: an on-demand action that clones a source
 * record ({@link #from}) into a new target record ({@link #to}), possibly in another model
 * ({@link #uses}) - e.g. generate a {@code SalesInvoice} from a {@code ProjectTimesheet}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The trigger is a click, an {@link #event} of the source, or both - see {@link #event} for the
 * at-most-once semantics an event-driven create-from carries.
 *
 * <p>
 * It generates two halves:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a client button contributed onto the {@link #forEntity} view via the app's
 * {@code <project>-custom-action} extension point (the {@code GeneratesIntentGenerator}), carrying
 * an {@code endpoint} rather than a page; and</li>
 * <li>a server-side Java {@code @Controller} (emitted through the {@code .glue} file + the
 * {@code template-application-events-java} template) that loads the source through its generated
 * repository, maps it onto a fresh target entity, and saves through the <b>target's</b> generated
 * repository - so the target's create-time logic (document numbering, status init, calculated
 * fields) fires naturally.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Mapping is split into two disjoint maps so the source-copy vs constant intent is unambiguous:
 * {@link #map} copies a source property onto a target property; {@link #defaults} sets a target
 * property to {@code now} (the current date) or a literal (string / integer / decimal / boolean).
 *
 * <p>
 * The composition line-items of the target are filled by exactly one of two mutually-exclusive
 * shapes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #items} (an OBJECT) - the <b>mirror</b> form: for each source item row a target item
 * row is created and its cells copied ({@code map}) / defaulted ({@code defaults}); and</li>
 * <li>{@link #itemLines} (a LIST) - the <b>computed</b> form (issue #6555): a fixed set of
 * synthetic target lines whose cells are EXPRESSIONS over the SOURCE record - numeric arithmetic
 * evaluated through {@code Calc} (as calculated fields / posting item amounts are), {@code {field}}
 * string interpolation, a source foreign-key copy, or a {@code now}/literal. This expresses the
 * "one line for the period's rolled-up total" invoice a create-from could not build before.</li>
 * </ul>
