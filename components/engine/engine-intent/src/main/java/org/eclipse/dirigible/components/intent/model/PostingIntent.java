/**
 * Declarative posting: when a (usually cross-model) source document reaches a status - or, for a
 * source with no status lifecycle (a booked payment), when it is created - create ONE local
 * document with computed multi-line content - the accounting "source document → balanced journal
 * entry" shape, generalized. The generated artifact is a client-Java {@code MessageHandler} on the
 * source's {@code -transitioned} (or, for {@code onCreate}, the bare create) topic that re-loads
 * the source by id (the event payload is as-of the event; later-step data such as a stamped number
 * is not in it), guards on the status, enforces at-most-once via the {@link #backReference},
 * resolves the {@link #rule} row, and writes the target document + items through their
 * repositories.
 *
 * <pre>
 * postings:
 *   - name: salesInvoicePosting
 *     event: { onTransition: SalesInvoice, model: sales-invoices, when: "Status == 3" }
 *     creates: JournalEntry
 *     backReference: SalesInvoice
 *     map: { EntryDate: date, Customer: Customer, Reason: "Sales invoice {number}" }
 *     rule: { entity: PostingRule, match: { documentType: "Sales Invoice" } }
 *     items:
 *       - { Account: rule(receivableAccount), debit: "Net + Vat" }
 *       - { Account: rule(revenueAccount),    credit: "Net" }
 *       - { Account: rule(vatAccount),        credit: "Vat", when: "Vat != 0" }
