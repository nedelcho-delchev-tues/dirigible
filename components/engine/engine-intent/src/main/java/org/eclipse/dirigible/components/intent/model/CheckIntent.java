/**
 * A declarative validation on an {@link EntityIntent} - the cross-field / cross-line rules a plain
 * {@code required}/{@code unique} cannot express. Five kinds:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code exactlyOne} (row-level): exactly one of {@link #fields} is non-null on the record (a
 * journal line is either debit or credit) - enforced on every user write;</li>
 * <li>{@code compare}: {@link #field} compared with {@link #op} either to {@link #than} - another
 * value of the SAME row that it must stand in a relation to (a due date not before the document
 * date, a validity end not before its start) - or to a {@link #value} LITERAL (a quantity greater
 * than zero, a percentage at most 100, a date not in the past). Row-level by default, so it is
 * enforced on every user write; with a {@link #status} gate it is the repository's, and holds when
 * the record is persisted carrying that status - "days &gt; 0 before SUBMITTED" rather than on the
 * first draft;</li>
 * <li>{@code requiredWhen}: {@link #field} - the record's own field, or a one-hop
 * {@code Relation.field} - must carry a value while {@link #when} holds (an e-mailed invoice needs
 * the customer's address). Enforced on every user write, or, with a {@link #status} gate, when the
 * document is persisted carrying that status - the moment the value is finally needed;</li>
 * <li>{@code forbidWhen}: the reject-twin of {@code requiredWhen} - reject the write while
 * {@link #when} holds (a payment allocation cannot be added to an already PAID invoice). It carries
 * no {@link #field}/value, only the condition; its one added reach is that a {@link #when} term may
 * name a one-hop {@code Relation.field}, so a child can test its parent (the status literal there
 * resolving against the relation target's nomenclature). Same gate rule as {@code requiredWhen}: no
 * gate = every user write (a 400 the generated controller raises), a gate = the repository when the
 * record is persisted carrying that status;</li>
 * <li>{@code itemsSumEqual} (document-level): the sums of the two {@link #over} fields across the
 * document's composition items are equal (the double-entry invariant) - enforced when the document
 * is persisted carrying the {@link #status} gate seed id, i.e. at the workflow transition;</li>
 * <li>{@code itemsMin} (document-level): the document has at least {@link #count} items - same
 * gate.</li>
 * </ul>
