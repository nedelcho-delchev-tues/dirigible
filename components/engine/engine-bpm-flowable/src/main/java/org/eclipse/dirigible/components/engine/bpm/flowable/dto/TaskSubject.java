/**
 * Where a task's row can read the business identity of the record it is about - the document's
 * number, its counterparty and its total, instead of the bare {@code Ref <id>} the BPM business key
 * left behind (issue #7077).
 * <p>
 * It carries LOCATORS, never values: the record's own REST URL and id, plus the properties to show
 * and how to read each one. The client resolves them live, exactly as the task form resolves the
 * record it edits - a subject snapshotted when the process started would state the total of a
 * document whose lines are added afterwards.
 * <p>
 * Everything here comes from process variables the generated trigger seeded: {@code __entityUrl} /
 * {@code __entityId} (the record), {@code __subjectFields} (the {@code <Property>:<kind>} list the
 * intent derived from the entity) and, per relation property, the {@code __<Property>EntityUrl} /
 * {@code __<Property>EntityLabel} pair the task form already uses to render a foreign key as a
 * name. A process that seeds none - a hand-authored BPMN, a deployment generated before #7077 - has
 * no subject and its rows keep reading as they did.
 *
 * @param url the record's REST controller URL
 * @param id the record's primary key
 * @param fields the properties to show, in reading order
